#  Weekend Worthy Afrobeats

Welcome to Weekend Worthy Afrobeats! If you're looking for the hottest tunes to groove to on your weekends, then you're in the right place! I've created this project which will be updated on a weekly basis, with curated Afrobeats tracks so that you can enjoy them without having to sift through hours of music. I will consider fans favorites across multiple streaming platforms, as well as what sounds good to me and my friends, in curating the playlist. This project is Developed by Bright Dikko.

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* I usually use heroku and aws to handle deployment, but just to practice for upcoming course sections, I deployed using Netlify only to realize that some of my builds were altered. Also, on chrome dev tools, the undeployed version of the website is pretty responsive, however after deploying to Netlify, that wasn't the case when I tried testing it on my phone.
