#  Weekend Worthy Afrobeats

Welcome to Weekend Worthy Afrobeats! If you're looking for the hottest tunes to groove to on your weekends, then you're in the right place! I've created this project which will be updated on a weekly basis, with curated Afrobeats tracks so that you can enjoy them without having to sift through hours of music. I will consider fans favorites across multiple streaming platforms, as well as what sounds good to me and my friends, in curating the playlist. This project is Developed by Bright Dikko.
